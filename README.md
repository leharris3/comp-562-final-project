## Overview
This project presents a real-time fire detection system developed for a machine learning class. We implement a fine-tuned MobileNet model, optimized for efficient on-device vision applications. We provide a lightweight yet accurate solution for identifying fires in real-time video feeds, which could be crucial for early fire detection and prevention measures.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Rapid identification of fire in video streams.
- **MobileNet Architecture**: Leverages the efficiency and speed of MobileNet.
- **Fine-Tuning for Fire Detection**: Specifically adapted to recognize various fire signatures.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed for straightforward implementation in various applications.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [URL of the repository]
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application (see usage instructions below).

## Usage

To use the fire detection system, follow these instructions:

1. Activate the system with the provided script:
   ```
   python fire_detection.py
   ```
2. Adjust the settings in `config.py` for your specific use case (optional).

## Dataset and Training

The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset of fire and non-fire images, ensuring robust detection capabilities. The fine-tuning process involved adjusting the last few layers of the pre-trained MobileNet model to better suit fire detection tasks.
